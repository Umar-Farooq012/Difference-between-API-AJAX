AJAX and an API are closely related. AJAX is a technology that allows web developers to create dynamic, interactive websites without
having to reload the page each time a user interacts with the website. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules 
and protocols that allow two different applications or services to communicate with each other.

AJAX relies on an API in order to make requests from the server and receive data from it. The API provides a way for the AJAX code to make requests to the 
server and receive data back in a format that can be used by the client-side code. This allows for dynamic, interactive websites without having to reload the
page each time a user interacts with it.

In summary, AJAX and an API are closely related because AJAX uses APIs to communicate with servers and receive data back in a format that can be used by the client-side code.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques used to create asynchronous web applications. 
It allows for the updating of web pages without the need for a full page refresh. An API (Application Programming Interface) 
is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. In the context of web development, AJAX is often used to make requests to an 
API in order to retrieve or send data to a server without disrupting the user's experience on the web page. So, the relationship between AJAX and an API is that AJAX can be 
used to make requests to an API in order to retrieve or send data asynchronously

Conceptually both are different things and they donâ€™t have any actual relationship.

AJAX is a front end technology for async backend calls from an html page through javasacript whereas, API widely provides back end data services in XML / JSON format.

With the rise of Angular JS / Jquery framework, it has changed the way we develop web sites and mobile applications. It encourage use of more Ajax calls to fetch the
data and the whole UI / presentation formatting can be manages by these frameworks.
